  "commentary": "Article 8, “Of the Three Creeds”, states: The Creeds, commonly called the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and the Athanasian Creed, are to be received and believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture. The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
