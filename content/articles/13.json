  "commentary": "Article 13, “Of Works before Justification”, states: Works done before the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God . The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
