  "commentary": "Article 32, “Of the Marriage of Priests”, states: Bishops, Priests and Deacons are not commanded by God's Law either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage . The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
