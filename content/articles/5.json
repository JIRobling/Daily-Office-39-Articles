  "commentary": "Article 5, “Of the Holy Ghost”, states: The Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God; who spake by the Prophets. The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
