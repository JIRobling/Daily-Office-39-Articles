  "commentary": "Article 24, “Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the People understand”, states: It is plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the primitive Church, to have public Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments in a tongue not understood of the people. The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
