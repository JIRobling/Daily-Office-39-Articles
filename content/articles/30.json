  "commentary": "Article 30, “Of both kinds”, states: The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people: for both the parts of the Lord's Sacrament . The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
