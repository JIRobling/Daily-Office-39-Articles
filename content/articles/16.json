  "commentary": "Article 16, “Of Sin after Baptism”, states: Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is damnable, only they who wilfully persist in them are in danger of damnation . The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
