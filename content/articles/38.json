  "commentary": "Article 38, “Of Christian men's Goods which are not common”, states: The riches and possessions which Christians have are theirs to use, and they are bound to distribute for the relief of the poor and for works of piety . The commentary below is a concise study essay offering historical context, theological significance, and suggestions for further study. Historically this Article reflects the Reformation effort to retain the catholic tradition where it is scriptural while rejecting practices viewed as unscriptural. For modern readers, note how this Article shapes worship, preaching, and ethical teaching, and compare it with patristic sources and later Anglican commentators.",
